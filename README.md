# Plant leaf Detection using CNN

# Overview:

- Application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for plant leaf detection.
- Utilizes deep learning and computer vision for automated leaf classification.

# Introduction:

- Plant leaf detection using CNNs is an advanced method in computer vision and agriculture.
- Neural networks automatically identify and classify leaves based on visual features.
- Focus on categorizing leaves into three types: healthy, powdery, and rust.
- Each type likely corresponds to specific health conditions or diseases in plants.
- Early identification facilitates timely interventions for improved crop management.
- Enhances overall health and productivity of plant species.
- Significant potential for sustainable and efficient agricultural practices.
